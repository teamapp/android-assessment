Phil has developed an app to show his 3 favourite photos along with detailed articles. Extend the app to show multiple photos and their authors returned by the Picsum API (https://picsum.photos/v2/list) in the photos index for Philâ€™s viewing pleasure. Add the most recently viewed images to the homescreen along with a view count, allow the user to like the image in the article view and display the like count in the photos index, you may use the existing descriptions provided by (https://baconipsum.com/api) in the Article section. Overlay a date in the format "yy/MM/dd_HHmm" on all images displayed in the three views (Home, Photos and Article)

Your implementation must be scalable, performant, testable, readable and easily maintained using user interface and programming best practices. Improve and enhance the UI/UX as you see fit. You may use third party standalone libraries as you see fit, the use of thirdparty framworks is discouraged for the purpose of this exercise.
