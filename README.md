Phil has developed an app to show his 3 favourite photos along with detailed articles. Extend the app to show multiple photos and their authors returned by the Picsum API (https://picsum.photos/v2/list) for Philâ€™s viewing pleasure. Add the most recently viewed images to the homescreen along with a view count, you may use the existing descriptions provided by (https://baconipsum.com/api) in the Article section. 

Your implementation must be scalable, performant, testable, readable and easily maintained using user interface and programming best practices. Improve the UI/UX as you see fit. You may use third party standalone libraries as you see fit, the use of thirdparty framworks is discouraged for the purpose of this exercise.
