## Functionality

Phil has developed an app to show his 3 favourite photos along with detailed articles. Extend the app to show multiple photos and their authors returned by the Picsum API (https://picsum.photos/v2/list) in the photos index for Philâ€™s viewing pleasure.

Add the most recently viewed images to the homescreen along with a view count. Allow the user to like the image in the article view (the detail screen) and display the like count in the photos index (the list screen). You may use the existing descriptions provided by (https://baconipsum.com/api) in the Article section. Overlay a date in the format "yy/MM/dd_HHmm" on all images displayed in the three views (Home, Photos and Article).

## UI/UX

You are expected to improve and enhance the UI/UX of the app. Things such as navigation, font sizes, spacing, etc. will all contribute to the evaluation of your work. You are allowed to remove UI elements that are confusing. You are encouraged to add content that will improve the overall usability of the app.

## Coding

Your implementation must be scalable, thread-safe, testable, readable and easily maintained using programming best practices. You may use third party standalone libraries as you see fit, but the use of invasive thirdparty frameworks is discouraged as it will make it difficult for us to assess your coding skills.

You can put some comments within the code to explain your reasoning.
